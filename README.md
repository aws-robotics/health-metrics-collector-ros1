# health_metric_collector


## Overview
This `health_metric_collector` ROS node collects system metrics and publishes them to `/metrics` topic. The `cloudwatch_metrics_collector` node is subscribed to this topic and will publish the metrics to AWS CloudWatch when it is instantiated.

## Installation

### AWS Credentials
You will need to create an AWS Account and configure the credentials to be able to communicate with AWS services. You may find [AWS Configuration and Credential Files] helpful. Specifying AWS [credentials by setting environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html) is not supported. 

This node will require the following AWS account IAM role permissions:
- `cloudwatch:PutMetricData`

### Building from Source
Create a ROS workspace and a source directory

    mkdir -p ~/ros-workspace/src

To build from source, clone the latest version from master branch and compile the package

- Clone the package into the source directory

        cd ~/ros-workspace/src
        git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/utils-common.git
        git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/utils-ros1.git
        git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/monitoringmessages-ros1.git
        git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/health-metrics-collector-ros1.git

- Install dependencies

        cd ~/ros-workspace && sudo apt-get update
        rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

- Build the packages

        cd ~/ros-workspace && colcon build
    
- Configure ROS library Path

        source ~/ros-workspace/install/setup.bash

- Build and run the unit tests

        colcon build --packages-select health_metric_collector --cmake-target tests
        colcon test --packages-select health_metric_collector && colcon test-result --all


## Launch Files
An example launch file called `sample_application.launch` is included in this project that gives an example of how you can include this node in your project together with the [`cloudwatch_metrics_collector`] node.


## Usage

### Run the node
- **With** launch file:
  - ROS: `roslaunch health_metric_collector sample_application.launch`

- **Without** launch file using default values
  - ROS: `rosrun health_metric_collector health_metric_collector`

### Running the sample application
To launch the sample application for the metrics node you can run the following command:

    roslaunch health_metric_collector sample_application.launch --screen


## Configuration file and Parameters
The `health_metric_collector` node receives an interval parameter that indicates the frequency in which it should sample metrics. e.g. interval=5 indicates sampling every five seconds. The default value is 5.

#### Supported Metrics Types
- Free RAM (in MB)
- Total RAM (in MB)
- Total cpu usage (percentage)
- Per core cpu usage (percentage)
- Uptime (in sec)
- Number of processes

## Performance and Benchmark Results
We evaluated the performance of this node by runnning the followning scenario on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B:

- Launch a baseline graph containing the talker and listener nodes from the [roscpp_tutorials package](https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp_tutorials), plus two additional nodes that collect CPU and memory usage statistics. Allow the nodes to run 60 seconds. 
- Launch the `health_metric_collector` ROS node using the launch file `sample_application.launch` as described above. That launch file also starts a `cloudwatch_metrics_collector` node, that forwards to the Amazon CloudWatch Metrics service each of the metric messages the `health_metric_collector` ROS node is publishing to the `/metrics` topic. 
- Allow the nodes to run for 180 seconds. 
- Terminate the `health_metric_collector` and `cloudwatch_metrics_collector` nodes, and allow the remaining nodes to run for 60 seconds. 

The following graph shows the CPU usage during that scenario. After launching the nodes with `sample_application.launch`, the 1 minute average CPU usage increases from around 7% to a peak of 15%, and stabilizes around 6%, until the nodes are stopped around second 266.

The following graph shows the memory usage during that scenario. We start with a memory usage of 225 MB for the baseline graph, that increases to 251 MB (+11.56%) when `sample_application.launch` is launched. Memory usage keeps stable until we stop the nodes, and after tthat it goes back to 225 MB.
